# Smart-Expense-Tracker
Smart Expense Tracker is a Flask-based web app that uses OCR to extract details from payment screenshots, classifies expenses into categories like Food or Groceries, and visualizes spending in a dashboard. Future upgrades include ML-based expense prediction and real-time tracking.
